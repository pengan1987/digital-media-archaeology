# Introduction

"[Hands-on Digital Media Archaeology](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]" is a series of experimental courses held at the Network Society Research Institute of the School of Intermedia Art, China Academy of Art, at the invitation of Professor Huang Sunquan. The first phase of this course took place between October and December 2021, and this manual has been compiled from the lecture notes of the classroom sessions.

As the first hands-on-centered media archaeology course in mainland China, I attempted to establish a small-scale media archaeology lab. The aim was to acquaint all participants with significant historical digital and electronic media through hands-on activities. This involved showcasing and experiencing outdated or "dead" media, also referred to as "obsolete media," along with media devices closely associated with technological advancements. Through these materials, the goal was to re-examine the origins of the characteristics present in today's digital media.

Often, certain features of media technology, seemingly insignificant today, played pivotal roles in history. The hope was that upon completing this course, whether engaging in related creative work, researching, or critiquing relevant pieces, participants would possess less unfamiliarity and greater comprehension of the associated technologies.

In this course, I presented a small selection of these media types in the classroom. Through these tangible materials, participants can reexamine the origins of the features in today's digital media that we use. Often, they may discover that some features of media technology, while seemingly insignificant today, have played crucial roles in history.

In this course, each episode will discuss a specific theme. For example, first episode is about mobile devices, while the second one will focus on web art. Before 2010, the web was quite different from what it is today. There was hardly any HTML5 (which was only widely adopted much later, in 2008), and many web contents required browser plugins for access.

For each episode's topic, it will first attempt to discuss how the IT industry and regular users utilized these technologies and devices at the time. Next, I will explore and showcase the works created by new media artists using these mediums. Additionally, the course will provide background information on specific media.
