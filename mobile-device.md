# Mobile Devices

Today, we are going to discuss our first topic: mobile devices. I have brought along many handheld computers, including various types of PDAs, electronic dictionaries, and UMPCs. Why are we starting this course by talking about PDAs and handheld computers? This is because "mobile computing" has become the most common form of computer use today. We are often glued to our mobile devices, as you can see, some students in this classroom still looking at their phones even now.

For this reason, when we discuss how people use computers and engage in "computing" today, the primary focus, at least in today's China, is on mobile devices represented by smartphones, running mobile operating systems like Apple's iOS or Android.

## Smartphone = PDA + Communication
So, let's officially begin our exploration of mobile devices. First, let's consider what a smartphone is. A smartphone is essentially a PDA with communication capabilities. Some students who are more interested in Apple products may remember a product called the "Apple Peel 520" around 2010, which was an accessory that turned the iPod Touch into an iPhone.

These accessories that transformed PDAs into smartphones actually appeared in the late 1990s. Representatives of early models include the Handspring Visor Phone on the far right in the picture. The Lenovo XP100+RG100 combination I brought with me is from 2002 or 2003. Typically, the XP100 PDA was sold independently, but if a user purchased an RG100 GPRS module[^1], they could effectively turn their XP100 PDA to turn it into a smartphone.

While it's true that this kind of mobile device capable of making calls has more in common with PDAs than the "feature phones" of the past, why do we call it a "smartphone" today and not a "connected PDA" or a "communicator"? The term "communicator" was once widely used to describe products that fell between PDAs and phones.

This is because all devices connected to the telecommunications network in China require this "blue sticker certificate", known as the "network access license." These devices are managed by industrial regulatory authorities as communication devices rather than computers. Whether it's China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology(CMIIT) or the United States' FCC, similar network access qualification certification(CMIIT ID / FCC ID) is required for devices sold in the respective countries that connect to the telecommunications network. Additionally, the primary sales channels for these devices have shifted from the computer market to the telecommunications equipment market. It is these regulatory and marketing factors that constitute the fundamental reason why this "PDA that can also be used as a phone" is referred to as a "smartphone."

The close association between smartphones and PDAs is often deliberately blurred and exploited by tech giants. For instance, Apple once tried to describe the iPhone as an improvement over "feature phones" rather than a continuation of PDAs. In a 2011 legal dispute between Apple and Samsung regarding touchscreen technology in mobile devices, Apple made the following statement in court:

> Before the iPhone, cell phones were utilitarian devices with key pads for dialing and small, passive display screens that did not allow for touch control.[^2]  

This description later became a ridiculous Internet meme because as early as 1992, the IBM Simon was a product equipped with a touchscreen, combining features of a PDA and a mobile phone. Furthermore, in 2002, the Handspring Treo 180 had already achieved a considerable level of success in the market. Among the devices I have showcased today, there is a newer Treo, as well as a Windows Mobile device similar to the HTC i-Mate in the image. The last one is the first-generation iPhone I mentioned earlier. We can clearly see that this evolution was continuous rather than revolutionary. Many times, the IT industry likes to claim how innovative and groundbreaking their products are, but often it's just a marketing tactic rather than a factual reality.

Today, I will primarily focus on the two most popular mobile computing platforms before the iPhone. One is Palm, which was both the name of a hardware manufacturer and a term commonly used to refer to a range of mobile devices running the Palm OS operating system developed by the company. For instance, the Sony Clie series of handheld computers, which also ran Palm OS and were compatible with most of Palm's software, were commonly referred to as "Palm" devices.

The other significant mobile computing platform that played a crucial role before the iPhone was Microsoft's Windows Mobile, also known as Pocket PC. Before the advent of Apple and Android, Palm OS and Windows Mobile, similar to today's iOS and Android, formed a duopoly in the mobile computing market.

## Synchronization

One of the first concepts that every PDA user learned in the 2000s was "synchronization." This was one of the most important distinctions between mobile computing devices and desktop computing devices before the advent of mobile internet. In the 2000s, many mobile devices lacked WLAN functionality and cellular data (mobile network) access. Additionally, the peripheral interfaces of mobile devices were typically limited; they couldn't connect via Ethernet cables or USB thumbdrives, and many models couldn't even accommodate flash memory cards (such as the Palm Vx and earlier models).

However, as computing devices, data exchange with the outside world was a necessity. They needed to connect to a PC through a data cable and perform "synchronization" to transfer data changes made on the mobile device to the PC and vice versa. Synchronization could maintain consistency of data between the PC and the PDA, effectively making the PDA a "mirror" of the PC counterpart application. This mode of operation was known as "PC Companion."

Before high-speed mobile data networks became widespread, "synchronization" was the most crucial method for PDAs to exchange data with the outside world. This functionality continued with iPhones and Android smartphones. If you've ever used an iPhone 3GS or an earlier iPhone and iPod, you might have used the synchronization feature. iTunes served as the desktop counterpart for the iPhone, similar to how Palm had Palm Desktop, and Windows Mobile had ActiveSync and Microsoft Outlook as its desktop counterpart.

Whether you were transferring songs or installing apps onto your iPhone, you could set it up through iTunes and then carry out the process through synchronization. Even today, the iPhone retains this functionality inherited from the PDA era.

Synchronization wasn't just for dealing with situations with no or slow internet access; it also served another purpose. Compared to PCs, mobile devices often had limited computing resources and supported fewer file formats. Desktop synchronization software could preprocess data, converting it into formats that mobile devices could handle, and when files were modified on the mobile device, they could be converted back to the PC format during synchronization, effectively reducing the complexity of mobile software.

## Mobile Interaction: Something unchanged for 20 Years

Next, I will provide a brief overview of the functions and use cases of PDAs. During the late 1990s and early 2000s when PDAs were popular, there were various terms used for them in China, such as "electronic notepad" and "handheld computer." There was also a popular advertising slogan: "Pager, Mobile phone, Shangwutong - one cannot be missing." "Shangwutong" was a popular PDA brand at the time and, in some contexts, became synonymous with PDAs.

In general, "handheld computer" usually referred to PDAs with more features than simple "electronic notepads," such as an open operating system has the ability for users to install third-party apps. For example, products using the Palm OS and Windows Mobile systems in the discussion that follows often emphasized that they were "handheld computers" rather than "electronic notepads" in the market at the time.

When we look at the PDAs of that era, especially those using the Palm OS, we find that they are very similar to today's mobile devices. For example, they typically had four application buttons. This design first appeared in the 1996 Palm Pilot, the first Palm OS handheld computer and the first commercially successful pocket-sized touchscreen computing device. The wooden prototype of the Palm Pilot created by Jeff Hawkins, the founder of Palm, has become one of the most classic prototype design cases in the history of mobile devices.

Most touchscreen mobile computing devices that came after the Palm Pilot, including today's smartphones, to some extent inherited the operational logic of the Palm Pilot. For example, my everyday smartphone, a VIVO Android phone, has a customized Android system called Origin OS. Its launcher is also composed of four app icons at the bottom and an area for app icons that occupy most of the screen, similar to the interactive logic that has persisted for 25 years.

## "The 'Four Heavenly Kings' and Their Utilization

Originating from the PDA's 'electronic notepad' function, the practice of managing personal information through mobile devices has permeated commercial culture and developed into a unique subculture. The use of mobile apps for 'GTD' (Getting Things Done) and 'time management' became popular among PDA enthusiasts in the mid-2000s, laying the foundation for later popular apps like Evernote and Omnifocus.

The core function of the 'electronic notepad,' in technical terms, is called 'PIM - Personal Information Management.' The 'Four Heavenly Kings' on Palm devices: Calendar, Phonebook, To-Do List, and Notes, constitute the most classic combination of a PIM system. Nearly all 'GTD' software is an extension or expansion of these 'Four Heavenly Kings.' For instance, Evernote is an enhanced version of a notepad, while Omnifocus is an enhanced version of a to-do list.

Next, I'd like to mention a software called ListPro. As its name suggests, it's also an enhanced version of a to-do list. However, under the various extreme uses by Windows Mobile enthusiasts, it became a 'Swiss Army Knife,' serving as a platform for sharing various data sets. For example, the 'Hangzhou Food Map' I'm showcasing displays addresses, contact information, recommended dishes, and reviews of Hangzhou restaurants from 2004, resembling a time-travel version of 'Dianping' (a popular Chinese restaurant review app). Enthusiasts from different places often share the information they've collected via forums. Here, I have several databases such as 'Beijing Travel Guide,' 'Digital Hefei,' 'Pocket Nanjing,' etc., serving as helpful tools for trip planning.

Another important function of PDAs is electronic dictionaries. Mdict[^3], the most successful domestic electronic dictionary software on Windows Mobile, is still one of the popular mobile dictionary apps."

However, the functionality of offline browsing (Web Clipping) might be a bit challenging for today's smartphone users to grasp. The basic function of an offline browser is to download web pages from the internet onto a PC and then synchronize them to be viewed on a mobile device. In the late 90s and early 2000s, many PDAs lacked internet connectivity, and even if they had it, data costs were usually relatively expensive. However, there was a genuine demand for news consumption on mobile devices, leading to the emergence of this indirect solution.

iSilo and HandStory were popular mobile offline browsing software at that time. MobiPocket, a mobile reading software acquired by Amazon in 2005, also had similar functionality. Worth mentioning is that the AZW format used by Amazon's Kindle e-readers originated from MobiPocket.

In China, when officials and academia mentioned mobile news services, they often preferred to highlight the 'mobile newspaper' services led by operators, supported through MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). They mentioned PDA's offline news browsing functionality less frequently. However, in my view, while mobile newspapers could provide immediate (WAP) and semi-immediate (MMS) news services, the screens of feature phones during that era were not ideal for reading. On the other hand, the operation of offline browsing on PDAs was more akin to the usage habits seen today in news apps like 'Toutiao' (Today's Headlines).

It's worth noting that this technology related to webpages was also used to develop some early web applications, such as Palm's Web Clipping initially employed on the Palm VII device. It utilized the Mobitex network, a 1G network with a speed of only 8 kbit/s, yet it was the first widely used Location-Based Service (LBS) platform.

Today, one can still find development tools for Web Clipping Applications (WCA, also known as Palm query applications) and understand the usage of this HTML-based web app development framework in accompanying documentation. However, due to the discontinued Palm.Net gateway and the unavailability of its communication protocols, we can only create WCAs that run entirely offline and cannot simulate the interactions with the internet as they were back then. Web technology was not only used through WCAs for app development; offline browser software like AvantGo could achieve similar functionality. It cached user operations on PDA websites and submitted them for results upon the next synchronization.

Another significant function of PDAs was gaming, with match-three games largely gaining success on PDAs. "Bejeweled," known among domestic enthusiasts as "Diamond Mine", was one of the must-have games among PDA enthusiasts at that time. The once hugely popular "Candy Crush" continued this success. Popular PC games like Monopoly, SimCity, and Age of Empires also had mobile versions on PDAs. Additionally, early augmented reality games emerged with the proliferation of cameras on mobile devices. For instance, in 2007, Arcade Reality appeared on the PalmOS platform, featuring functions similar to the mix of enemies and scenes in games like Pokémon GO, but it was a full nine years ahead of its time.

## Beam: Infrared Transmission

In the world of PDAs, there's another important and fun concept called "Beam", which involves transferring data via infrared. In the Palm user community, exchanging business cards via infrared was one of the most representative gestures among "Palm enthusiasts". Long-pressing the "Phonebook" button on a Palm device would activate the infrared transmission icon. At that point, I could align the infrared interface of my Palm with another Palm device, and the other Palm would receive the business card I had set up. Palm's classic ad "Meeting on the Train" showcased the use of Beam.

Infrared, as the most common wireless communication method for mobile devices in the late 90s and early 2000s, was not only used for quick data exchange between devices but also for software distribution and digital marketing. Some exhibitions during that time set up "Beaming Stations" equipped with infrared transmitters, allowing PDA users at the event to receive software and product information. Dodge used infrared at the 2001 Detroit Auto Show to offer mobile app downloads to the audience[^4], representing a significant case of PDA utilization in digital marketing.

## Multimedia Features
One of the most significant changes in PDAs after 2000 was the enhancement of multimedia capabilities. Particularly, Pocket PCs using the Windows Mobile operating system gradually shifted from being followers to leaders in competition with Palm OS, largely due to their rich multimedia functionalities. Windows Mobile included Internet Explorer, allowing direct access to WWW websites. However, although Pocket IE on Windows resembled its PC counterpart in logic, it wasn't considered user-friendly. Enthusiasts at that time preferred using the mobile versions of Opera Mobile and later UCWeb. Notably, UC Browser later became the most popular mobile browser in China and was acquired by Alibaba in 2014.

In addition to the mobile version of Internet Explorer, Microsoft also provided a mobile version of Windows Media Player for Windows Mobile. It operated similarly to desktop Windows and supported popular network audio formats like MP3 and WMA. However, due to limitations in mobile device performance, playing videos on Pocket PCs at that time required specialized compression into lower-resolution mobile formats. Naturally, some PDA websites also offered pre-compressed video downloads.

Furthermore, network multimedia technologies like Adobe Flash and VRML emerged on Windows Mobile. The upcoming works of some artists we'll see also utilize these multimedia technologies within these browsers.

## Investigate the works in (re)distributions.

Around the turn of the millennium, artists began creating more on the PDA platform. New media artist Patrick Lichty launched an online exhibition "(re)distributions" in 2001, showcasing numerous PDA-related artworks. One category of works was rather straightforward, such as Tom Kemp's "Analysis," a digital drawing directly created using the Palm handheld's touchscreen and TealPaint drawing software. Similarly, Olia Lialina's comic "Zombie & Mummy"[^5] utilized Palm and TealPaint as creative tools.

Leveraging TealPaint's popularity among mobile digital artists, the developers set up a "Gallery"[^6] section on their website, specifically collecting user-submitted artwork created using PDAs and TealPaint.

PDAs, as unique digital drawing tools, attracted attention in academic circles as well. Margaret Dolinsky from Indiana State University extensively discussed drawing on PDAs in her paper "Life Drawing: PDA Required."

However, many creations used PDAs as platforms offering unique experiential content. For instance, Mark Amerika's "How to be a Net Artist" was an art publication optimized for reading on Palm using Acrobat Reader. GH Hovagimyan's PalmRants[^7] explored the use of mobile devices as image playback devices. Gregory Little's "PID" utilized Windows Mobile's VRML capabilities, showcasing a three-dimensional space on a touchscreen. Orit Kruglanski implemented interactive poetry where users could interact with text via the touchscreen.

Chiaki W. Darcy's "MetaSonic," Debra Hampton's "from the edge," David Crawford's "lightofspeed ppc," and Peter Dukes' "Glasshouse" all attempted to incorporate Flash animations and interactivity into mobile devices, transforming the PDA into a medium that offered a unique viewing experience.

James Buckhouse and Holly Brubach's piece "Tap," created with the assistance of choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and interactive artist Scott Snibbe, resulted in the creation of "Tap"[^8]. This program allowed the audience to choreograph dance sequences themselves, with virtual dancers on the screen practicing these moves and making mistakes in their actions. The dance sequences generated by the Tap program could also be transmitted to other audience members via Beam infrared transmission.
