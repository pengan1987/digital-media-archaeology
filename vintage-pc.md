# Old-School Personal Computers

Welcome to the sixth session of this course, where we're delving into old-school personal computers. As a vintage computer enthusiast, I'm excited to discuss old-school computers today. In our classroom, I've set up several older computers to explore what we generally refer to as old-school computers, Retrocomputing, or other similar terms.

In the public's perception, a computer from ten years ago might already be considered "old." However, for gaming enthusiasts, a computer from two or three years ago might be deemed "old" as many of the newest games they wish to play struggle to run smoothly.

## "Old-school Computers" in the Demoscene

Yet, for researchers in digital art, defining "Old-school computers" depends greatly on those who continue to create on these machines. There's still a passionate group actively creating new digital art on old computers. Particularly in Europe, there's a vibrant community of enthusiasts creating in such a realm, known as the Demoscene. The Demoscene, like an "underground music scene," revolves around a specific topic, focusing naturally on their visual and auditory "demonstrations" or demos.

So, what's a "demo"? It's a real-time generated, non-interactive computer audio-visual presentation program. To put it simply, if you've ever used Processing for programming, a program developed using Processing to generate animated effects is akin to a demo. The visuals in these programs are computed by the computer in real-time, unlike After Effects where the computer pre-renders a video to be played later. Consequently, the effects produced when a demo runs are limited by the hardware specifications, especially the computer's CPU, graphic chips, memory, and other components. Moreover, the non-interactive nature distinguishes demos from games; while both generate real-time graphics, games involve complex interactive elements, while demos solely focus on their visual and sound effects.

For the Demoscene community, the most significant events are demoparties, where members gather to exchange techniques and showcase their works. Just last weekend (November 12-13, 2021), a Demoparty called Demosplash was held at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States. Let's take a look at what happens at these parties: they cut Commodore 64-themed cakes and create works using old computers like the Amstrad CPC. Inside the computer club at Carnegie Mellon University, they display numerous old computers, similar to the ones set up in our classroom, replicating a small part of their environment.

This is a typical, active community of vintage computer enthusiasts, tied to university activities. How do they define old computers in such communities? They organize compos, which are demo-making competitions, divided into several categories, with "Retro" being a category specifically for old computers.

The rules of the Demosplash competition [^1] state:

> A "retro" platform is, roughly speaking, anything not in current or recent production. As a rule of thumb, anything produced before the year 2000 falls into this category. Arguments for more recent platforms must be raised with the organizers in advance.

According to these rules, most of the computers I brought today likely fall within these standards. The most recent configuration among these is the Celeron 533Mhz, manufactured in 2000, with an SIS620 chipset motherboard from 1999, which could be considered the latest boundary for meeting these criteria. However, in some other competitions, there might be stricter definitions. For instance, at the Revision Party in Germany, which hosts a demoscene competition, they define it like this [^2]:

> Allowed platforms are Home Computers, Home Consoles and Handhelds up to and including the time period of the 4th generation of Video Game Consoles and Handheld Systems up to and including period of the 5th generation or any device with a CPU that has a 16 bit or smaller data bus.

So, what does the fourth-generation game console entail? It refers to the 16-bit game consoles released from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Examples include the Sega Genesis, also known as the Sega MegaDrive, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), CD-I, Neo Geo, and others. Although Neo Geo had fewer home players, its motherboard closely resembled to Capcom's CPS arcade machines, featuring popular games like SNK's "King of Fighters" series.

The situation in Europe involves a stricter definition of "old-school computers" within the community. The boundary between "new" and "old" typically falls around the early 1990s. The rules set by the Assembly Party in Finland are very detailed [^3]. For instance, in the real-time generation category, they divide it into sections like 1K intro, 4K intro, and so on, referring to the program's size—1K is 1024 bytes, and 4K is 4096 bytes. It's a stringent restriction because even with 4096 bytes, there's only space for about 4000 characters. Creating executable programs within such small confines while generating various effects is a significant challenge, testing the developers' skills and thinking.

Other categories include "Oldskool 8-bit and 16-bit," which roughly corresponds to the requirements of the Revision Party in Germany. Among the machines I presented today, the Subor SB2000 and the Laser 310 fit into this category.

However, our Celeron 533Mhz PC, being closer to the Pentium II or III level, doesn't meet these group requirements. Yet, it still possesses noticeable differences from today's PCs. Therefore, the Assembly Party has established an additional category for such old computers, labeled "Oldskool 32-bit and 64-bit" to describe this hardware level. However, it explicitly mentions, "Do not use 3D accelerator cards on the PC platform because it exceeds the specifications of the competition model."

They've specified the competition model as a Pentium 133Mhz, S3 86C775 graphics card, Gravis Ultrasound Extreme sound card, 32MB of memory, and DOS. Hence, while our computer could be used for developing demos in this category, it's still too advanced compared to the competition's requirements. To participate in this category, the demos created must avoid using hardware like 3D accelerator cards and software environments like Windows95, DirectX API, OpenGL, or other modern 3D APIs used in modern game development.

From a gaming console perspective, approximately speaking, the fifth-generation gaming consoles represented by the PlayStation serve as a demarcation line. These consoles feature a 32-bit RISC CPU and polygonal 3D acceleration chips. In more lenient competitions, machines from this generation might be included in the "Oldskool" category. However, stricter communities might exclude them from the "Oldskool" classification.

Regarding what the demoscene community does on old computers during demo parties, enthusiasts create demos containing various graphical effects. These works are non-interactive, unlike games. They emphasize showcasing developers' understanding of vintage computer software/hardware environments, graphical programming skills, and their mastery of arranging combinations of audio and video effects.

## Basic 8-bit Computers (1977~1990s)

Let's delve into the specifics of these old computers and their internal differences. While we often refer to the "8-bit" style today, the 8-bit era can generally be divided into two phases or two generations. The first generation comprises early 8-bit computers represented by the commercial release of three personal computers in 1977: the Commodore PET, Apple II, and Tandy TRS-80 Model I. These three computers appeared almost simultaneously, with Apple II hitting the market a few weeks earlier than the other two.

Among the 1977 personal computers, the most famous was the Apple II, featuring functionalities that the other two didn't possess. One was a floppy disk drive—a significant achievement by Apple co-founder Wozniak, whose enhancements made floppy drives more affordable and better-performing, suitable for widespread use in home computers. Another crucial feature was Apple II's support for color graphics, unlike the other two computers that only supported monochrome imagery. Thus, Apple II was the most feature-rich among the three 1977 personal computers, making it one of the most important early personal computers.

This generation of computers utilized 8-bit CPUs and had basic graphics output capabilities but lacked graphical features like scrolling and sprites, common in later 8-bit games. Super Mario Bros. is a typical "scrolling and sprite" game where the background is a scrolling image processed by a graphics chip, enabling seamless movement. Characters move across this scrolling background, known as active sprites.

However, early 8-bit computers lacked such graphic acceleration features. They could only control graphics output by having the CPU write image data to the display memory. Additionally, these computers lacked dedicated sound chips; producing sound required the CPU to control the speaker to emit simple beeps. As a result, both graphics and sound demanded significant CPU resources, leaving little room for complex sound effects and background music in games of that era, prioritizing resources for processing user interactive.

These kinds of computers typically used cassette tapes or floppy disks as external storage. In the previous class, I tried loading programs onto the Laser 310 using a cassette tape, but it didn't load. Later, following tips from other enthusiasts, I found out that turning up the volume on my phone allowed the Laser 310 to load the program.

Apart from Apple II, the first generation of popular 8-bit computers included models like the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, TRS-80, among others. Unfortunately, these machines are quite hard to find in China. However, there are online emulators, allowing us to try out Apple IIe and play representative games like "Lode Runner." While the NES version of "Lode Runner" was popular in China, its initial platform was the Apple II computer. In the video below, you can find "Lode Runner" running on various platforms.

Another noteworthy game is "Ant Attack," which was on the ZX Spectrum platform. It was one of the earliest isometric 2.5D games on personal computers. This game, released in 1983, still has a website, and its author, Sandy White, was interviewed by the "From Bedrooms to Billions" documentary crew in 2011.

Let's return to our demonstration machine, the Vtech Laser 310. It's similar to most 8-bit personal computers, booting directly into the BASIC interupter after power on. Users could perform calculations or write programs directly through commands. You'll notice that these computers' keyboards often feature various block symbols, commonly used for constructing game graphics. Similar characters can also be found on the Sinclair ZX81.

The Laser 310 appeared later, in 1985. It was an affordable low-end 8-bit computer at the time, lacking robust video and sound chips, displaying only 8 colors, and offering limited sound effects. It floppy disk drives were not very common on these machines; most users loaded programs from cassette recorders using audio cables. Its functionality level remained within the realm of the first generation of 8-bit computers.

## Advanced 8-bit Computers (1979~1990s)

However, the "second generation" of 8-bit computers appeared earlier than the Laser 310. Shortly after the first batch of home computers in 1977, Atari attempted to integrate rich graphics and sound features from gaming consoles into computers. In 1979, Atari released the first home computers equipped with dedicated graphics and sound processing chips: the Atari 8-bit series. This series included the Atari 400 and Atari 800 as its initial models, with 4KB and 8KB of memory, respectively. Both computers were equipped with dedicated graphics and sound chips, enabling them to feature scrolling and sprite capabilities, features that were previously exclusive to gaming consoles.

The advanced 8-bit home computers, starting with the Atari 8-bit series, boasted stronger graphic and sound capabilities, surpassing earlier or lower-end 8-bit home computers like the Apple II, TRS-80, or Laser 310. Consequently, most 8-bit demos in the demoscene were developed around this generation of home computers. For instance, the Commodore 64 became the most popular 8-bit demo platform. Even today, many enthusiasts continue to create around it. When discussing the 8-bit style in Europe and America, the visual and auditory style of the Commodore 64 often springs to mind.

Commodore 64 demos have evolved for over 30 years, refining their styles. Many established techniques have been solidified, such as scrolling text, colored bars, pseudo-3D models, and video clips. Many functionalities employed in Commodore 64 computers were initially unforeseen, such as the lack of high-speed full-screen refresh capabilities needed for video playback on 8-bit computers. Special methods had to be devised to process video frames for full-screen video playback. These effects in demos evolved over generations as enthusiasts experimenting, hacking, and accumulating knowledge. The potential of the Commodore 64 was gradually unearthed to its fullest extent through this process.

Popular advanced 8-bit home computers equipped with dedicated graphics and sound chips, besides the Atari 800, Atari 400, and Commodore 64, also included the Amstrad CPC and MSX.

Amstrad CPC, a popular British computer, was released in 1984. You can also try its emulator online. Games like "1943" showcase typical scrolling and sprite graphics along with multi-channel chip music, representing the standard features of later 8-bit computers and gaming platforms.

MSX, a series of popular 8-bit home computers in Japan, hosted several notable games. For instance, the initial "Metal Gear" series appeared on the MSX platform. In the first "Metal Gear," while there wasn't scrolling, the background remained static while the character sprites were dynamic. When the character reached the edge of the background, the entire scene transitioned to the next area.

In contrast to game developers who mostly adhered to hardware specifications and original settings, demoscene productions often aimed to surpass these limitations. They ventured into features like active 3D models and full-screen videos, capabilities that 8-bit home computer graphics chips couldn't offer but were achieved through enthusiasts' efforts.

## Computers Becoming Game Consoles, Game Consoles Becoming Computers

During the 8-bit era, many game consoles and computers shared the same or similar hardware architecture. For instance, the chipsets of the Atari 8-bit series were also utilized in the Atari 5200 game console. Similarly, the Commodore 64 computer's chipset was utilized in the Commodore 64 Games System. These chipsets were initially used in home computers and then adapted for game console development. Conversely, some instances involved developing game consoles first and later expanding them into home computers. For example, the Coleco Adam computer developed based on the ColecoVision, and Nintendo's Famicom had the Family BASIC accessory, which eventually spawned educational computer or "learning machines."

Another demo machine we have today is the Subor SB2000, released in 1998, which was among the last batches of 8-bit home computers. Its configuration was quite extravagant compared to many well-known 16-bit computers of the 1980s. Its 1MB of memory surpassed the capacities of several prominent 16-bit computers. For instance, the base model of the initial IBM PC in 1981 had only 16K of memory, the first Macintosh in 1984 had 128K, and the Amiga 500 in 1987 was only equipped with 512KB of memory. It wasn't until later with the 286 computers that 1MB of memory started becoming standard. There's a long-standing quip attributed to Bill Gates about "640K being enough to run all DOS programs," which, in perspective, illustrates how 1MB was a significant capacity for 8-bit computers.

The Subor SB2000 utilized the UMC UM6576 CPU, which, compared to the commonly used UM6561 CPU in domestic gaming consoles, mainly improved on input/output interfaces. The UM6576 introduced standard keyboard and mouse interfaces compatible with IBM PCs. It also supported the PC-standard 1.44MB floppy disk, a considerable capacity for an 8-bit computer, especially since most 8-bit computers typically had floppy disks with just over 100KB capacity. Additionally, in terms of audio and graphics, the Subor SB2000 largely inherited the setup from domestic gaming consoles but added speech synthesis capabilities in its sound functionality.

Subor SB2000 comes equipped with a complete DOS firmware that supports most PC-DOS commands. Many educational software programs also utilize PCM speech, which is a relatively advanced feature for an 8-bit computer.

As the Subor SB2000 was primarily sold in China, it lacks the active developer community seen in overseas demoscene communities. Hence, many of its functionalities remain largely unexplored even today. Most of the demos I'll be showcasing next were developed by foreign enthusiasts for NES.

The Subor SB2000 can run many demos developed for regular NES. Since it can utilize floppy disks, we can directly write the ROM onto a floppy disk instead of burning it onto a cartridge. Compared to regular NES, developing and debugging on the Subor SB2000 as a home computer is slightly more convenient.

In the first demo, we'll see common demoscene elements like rotating 3D cubes and scrolling texts, often conveying greetings to other demo groups or attendees of these gatherings. This demo is relatively straightforward, featuring just one effect. The second demo is a bit more complex, serving as a 2020 New Year's e-card.

The DOS system used in the Subor SB2000 is quite similar to those used by several other educational computer systems in China, such as the BBK Floppy Model 1, the BBK Model 98, and the Bang Dr.PC Jr. Additionally, it's worth noting that during the development of the Subor SB2000, there was involvement from the Technical Leadership Academy of the Defense Industry Commission. It's conceivable that the Subor SB2000 might have been used for military purposes. Perhaps using an 8-bit computer like the Subor SB2000 in a post-apocalyptic setting would make for an intriguing sci-fi concept.

## Chip Music
Another community developed on 8-bit personal computers, somewhat tangential to Demoscene, was the chip music community. As I mentioned earlier, in the "second generation" of 8-bit computers, there were additional sound chips, different in functionality from the sound cards we use on PCs today. Most modern PC sound relies on recording samples and playing them back, but sampling on 8-bit computers required a lot of storage space. The SB2000 leveraged a 1.44MB floppy drive from the '90s, allowing PCM sampling for storing voice data, but high-quality music recording and playback remained quite challenging.

Therefore, sound on 8-bit computers was typically generated using Programmable Sound Generators (PSGs) or sound chips. Most sound chips had 2 to 4 waveform channels and a noise channel. For instance, the Commodore 64's SID chip had three waveform channels plus a noise channel, while the NES had a combination of 4 waveforms and 1 noise channel. Today, the primary method for creating music using sound chips involves using a tracker, a type of sequencer. It works by placing a series of commands that control the sound chip onto timed tracks to compose music.

We can use CajoNES[^4] on the Subor SB2000 to try creating a piece of chip music. This software follows the typical tracker operating mode. If you're familiar with newer music production software, you'll find it similar to a drum machine. The interface displays headers like IPA, IPB, IPC, MDA, MDB, MBC, corresponding to channels A, B, C. In the NES's four channels, A and B are square waves, C is a triangle wave, and D is noise, so A and B share adjustable elements, while C and D have different ones. The final column is CTRL, for control tracks, used for loop or stop commands.

CajoNES automatically loads an example on startup. We can experiment with the music-making process by modifying this example. For example, IPA/IPB sets the starting note pitch, MDA/MDB changes the pitch while playing, MSA/MSB adjusts the pitch change speed, and EVA/EVB control amplitude and decay. By modifying these notes, you can create the musical phrases you desire. The existence of multiple channels also enables the sound chip to produce complex polyphonic music. Chip music sometimes involves more experimental methods, like SMMM[^5], a easy to use noise generation software.

## 16-Bit Computers and Tracker Music
Moving on to 16-bit personal computers, their functionality is more relatable to today's computers. The most common 16-bit personal computer processor was the Intel 80x86 and its compatible processors, often referred to as x86 processors. These processors were either successors or derivatives of the Intel 8086. Besides the IBM PC, x86 processors were also used in models like the NEC PC-98 and Fujitsu FM Towns, which were incompatible with the IBM PC.

Another significant 16-bit processor was the Motorola 68000 series, employed in computers like the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh, and gaming platforms such as the Sega Genesis and Philips CD-I.

Both Commodore Amiga and Atari ST used the Motorola 68000 processor and supported graphical interfaces. The key feature of 16-bit computers during this era was the widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces. Systems like the Apple Macintosh, Amiga OS, GEM used by Atari ST, and the popular Microsoft Windows on IBM PCs all began supporting mouse-driven windowed operations. Additionally, some hardware platforms introduced high-color display capabilities.

Sound generation began to bifurcate into two methods: one akin to 8-bit personal computers, employing sound chips controlled by registers, although these chips were more powerful, capable of generating multiple simultaneous voices. A typical example was the AdLib sound card, capable of FM synthesis with up to 9 voices. The other method involved the use of digital audio, where computers supported direct playback of digitized audio samples. For instance, the Amiga computer's Paula chip supported playback of 8-bit samples at up to 57KHz and offered dual-channel stereo output.

During the mid-to-late 1980s into the early 1990s, the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST platforms produced the most demoscene works. However, the Macintosh had relatively fewer creations due to popular models like Mac SE and Mac Classic having monochrome screens, while the color-capable Macintosh II was expensive and less common. The IBM PC platform gradually became widely used in the 1990s with the advent of the 386, 486 processors, and later Pentium-level computers, owing to the emergence of numerous affordable and powerful third-party sound and graphics cards.

Next, I'll showcase a program called AdLib Tracker. Its functionality is somewhat similar to CajoNES mentioned earlier; both are sequencer-based music production software. As the name suggests, AdLib Tracker was a tracker software developed for the AdLib sound card. Although the original AdLib sound card is difficult to find today, the Yamaha YM3812 (OPL2) chip used in the AdLib sound card is still relatively easy to obtain. Hence, enthusiasts developed the OPL2LPT, an external AdLib sound card connected to the computer's LPT printer port.

The YM3812 chip can support 9 voices, more than the NES's 4 voices, and offers a richer variety of FM synthesis sounds. However, you'll notice that music created using sound chips often lacks human voices or speech because vocals usually require sampled playback. Additionally, when you stop playback midway in a Tracker software, the music sometimes continues playing the last note. This is because Tracker sequentially sends commands to the sound chip; if it sends a "continue playing" command without a "stop" command, the sound chip won't stop.

Similar software based on sampling, like the Amiga's, is also termed a "Tracker." Its origin lies in modifying, arranging, and composing music using samples. Sound chip Trackers, as a result of their acceptance in the enthusiast community, incorporated operation methods from the sampling-based Trackers. I'll show FastTracker, one of the most common Tracker software for DOS.

OPL2LPT doesn't support FastTracker because the YM3812 chip lacks a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to convert digital signals to analog. So, we employ the Covox Speech Thing, a simple 8-bit DAC capable of playing digital audio samples. In FastTracker, you can individually view and play these samples.

If the PSG sound chip represents a programmable controlled synthesizer, then digital sample playback resembles a set of programmed controlled sampling recorders and effectors. While their operational logic in Tracker software may seem similar, their sound generation principles are quite distinct. These were the two most common forms of computer music during the 16-bit computer era.

## Windows: Transitioning to "New-School" Computers
Essentially, the era of "old-school" computers culminated with Windows. Particularly, after the advent of Windows 95, it revolutionized multimedia software development on PCs, ushering in a transformation in the entire multimedia ecosystem, from software to hardware. Both the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga computers were overshadowed by Windows 95, and one could argue that the Wintel combination of IBM PC and Windows had already established dominance during the Windows 3.1 era.

One significant change was how Windows 3.x redefined APIs for handling audio and video on computers. Henceforth, computers with Windows installed became what I mentioned earlier as modern multimedia computers. Our Celeron 533Mhz machine can also run Windows 3.x, allowing us to experience the multimedia features of Windows 3.x.

Microsoft provided a series of standard multimedia APIs in Windows 3.x (specifically Windows 3.0 Multimedia Extensions and subsequent versions). The audio component utilized MIDI as an API for digital instruments and synthesis, also supporting digital audio recording and playback APIs but not providing APIs for PSG or FM synthesis. Under Windows 3.x, hardware drivers simulated MIDI devices using the sound card's FM synthesis. Software interacted with these features in the same way as with standard MIDI devices, reducing the distinctiveness between different sound card chips and leading many to misconstrue the FM synthesis capability of sound cards as "MIDI functionality."

In Windows 98, Microsoft integrated the Microsoft GS Software Wavetable Synthesizer. When using this, the system employed software for sound synthesis and directly transmitted it to the sound card in digital audio format without sound card's FM synthesis capability. This significantly minimized differences in functionalities among sound card chips, and Windows developers no longer needed to understand the technical details of different sound card chips as they did in the DOS era. This sowed the seeds for the decline of dedicated sound cards.

Our demonstration machine runs Windows 3.2, an enhanced Chinese version of Windows 3.1 released in 1994, just a year earlier than Windows 95. Windows 3.2 was the first Windows version to gain popularity in China and was also my first experience with Windows. Windows 3.2 brought significant changes to China's software ecosystem, notably with the release of Word and Excel's Chinese Windows versions, nearly cornering domestically developed office software like WPS and CCED.

Windows 3.2 had many characteristics of contemporary multimedia PCs. For instance, Microsoft's Encarta 94 Multimedia Encyclopedia largely abandoned the legacy of 8-bit home computers. As a modern multimedia software, it leveraged the vast storage capacity of CD-ROMs, using entirely pre-recorded digital audio for sound files and video via video-encoded compressed footage. This perfectly aligns with the traits of multimedia PCs discussed earlier.

In 1994, Microsoft introduced the WinG graphics API for Windows 3.x, followed by DirectX in 1995. These APIs significantly facilitated the development of high-performance 3D graphics applications for Windows, enabling developers to focus less on hardware differences and more on leveraging the functionalities provided by Windows. This changed the approach to developing high-performance multimedia software on PCs.

Especially with the emergence of 3D graphics cards, utilizing operating system APIs like OpenGL or Direct 3D allowed achieving effects previously difficult to attain. In the demoscene community, new development techniques focused more on operating system APIs rather than specific hardware characteristics. Even today, multimedia software development on PCs primarily revolves around DirectX. This difference in development methodology marks the real boundary between Oldschool and Newschool demos beyond hardware specifications, and it's the core difference distinguishing "vintage computers" from "modern computers."
